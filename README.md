# MachineLearning1
My first attempt at writing a machine learning algorithm in python.This is a way of our team
learning the fundamentals of ML in python so that we are better prepared to compete in ML
competitions from Kaggle. The Eventual goal is that all team members will fully understand
basic concepts of Supervised Machine Learning. Both of the ML models in this project are based
off of the Iris data set.
